# Civic Tech Atlanta

Organizing our community to work on civic-minded, social good projects that make metro Atlanta more **inclusive**, **diverse**, **equitable**, and **accessible**

## Who we are
We partner with local organizations and governments on civic-minded projects that make metro Atlanta more inclusive, diverse, equitable, and accessible.

## What we do
We hold hack nights monthly. We invite participants to bring their ideas, and to work with others to bring those ideas to life. We are software developers, designers, project managers, data scientists, policy wonks, and subject-matter experts.
