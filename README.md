A proposed alternative option for Civic Tech Atlanta's website

# Getting Started

You need to be in the directory that contains the docker-compose.yml file

Run the following command in a terminal:

```
docker compose up -d 
```

View your locally deployed site at http://localhost:4000

This should be all you need to get the project up and running
